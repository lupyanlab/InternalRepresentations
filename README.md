# Internal Representations Questionnaire

To be able to download data directly from Qualtrics,
you need to find your API Token and record it in
the file "qualtrics.yml".

You can find your Qualtrics API Token by navigating
to **Account Settings**, and then **Qualtrics IDs**.
Click "Generate Token" if you haven't been assigned
one yet.

Once you have your API Token, copy it and paste it
into the correct place in "qualtrics.yml".
